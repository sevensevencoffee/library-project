The Odin Project: JavaScript Library Project

In this project, I will enhance my knowledge of JavaScript objects by creating an interactive library application where users can input books. Key features will include the title, author, number of pages, and a status indicating whether the book has been read.


1. There needs to be a constructor so all the inputted value will be stored as a new Var 
2. The inputted values will need to captured and stored into the new Variables
3. Add a button that will generate a pop up which will ask for input 
4. Need to create an array of books so the main screen will store these books on the main page
